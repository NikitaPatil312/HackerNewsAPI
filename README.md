# HackerNewsAPI

After running the application use below url on postman or browser

https://localhost:7197/Stories/n

n = Pass number of stories you want to fetch

[E.g. https://localhost:7197/Stories/3]

[Please note localhost:7197 is for https, you can find other urls in launchSettings.json file]

P.S. I have assumed data coming from https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/beststories.json is sorted in descending order of score.
